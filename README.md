Crop recommendation or prediction using machine learning involves leveraging algorithms to analyze various factors such as soil quality, climate conditions, historical yield data, and crop characteristics to suggest the most suitable crops for a particular area. By processing this information, machine learning models can generate accurate predictions or recommendations, helping farmers make informed decisions about crop selection, optimize yield, and improve agriculturalÂ sustainability.
